# Node Weather App
## [Demo](https://node-weather-weba.herokuapp.com/)

The first official weather forecast ever appeared on the first of August 1861. The legendary vice-admiral Robert Fitzroy, a royal-navy officer and pioneer in meteorology, was collecting data for his Meteorological Office from 15 land stations across England. Nowadays, there are over 40000 stations across our planet, accessible via free, affordable, advanced, and accurate technologies. So what are we waiting for?

## What Is a Weather API?

An API (application programming interface) is a form of pre-defined interaction between the client and the service.

## Weather APIs allow us to:

* cooperate with powerful and enormous data storage,
* get historical weather records,
* access forecasts for any point on Earth.

## APIs used:

* [Weather Stack](https://weatherstack.com/)
* [Map Box](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/search/geocoding/)


## Node.js

For this project, we used node.js – one of the most popular run-time environments for JavaScript.

Node.js helps create fast and advanced web applications. It has many additional libraries/modules for any purpose.

## Express

* [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - Express is a lightweight framework for node.js to work with fully provided web instruments. It helps run a server, handle requests from the client, and connect the correct HTML/ejs template with a response. You can read more details about ejs + express solutions here.

## View Engine 

* [hbs - Handlebars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hbs) - template language for implementing js objects inside of HTML documents. It’s useful when you need to receive some data from your scripts and dynamically show it on your web page.
